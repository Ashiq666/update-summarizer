Bangladesh,G:\400\website\files//AFP_ENG_20050119_1.0019,"Indian and Pakistani military commanders were to discuss Wednesday Indian charges that Pakistan fired mortar shells across the border into Indian-controlled Kashmir in violation of a 14-month ceasefire. The director-generals of military operations of the nuclear-armed neighbours were slated to talk by telephone about the incident that occurred late Tuesday. ""The director generals of military operations will be talking later today,"" an Indian government official said, declining to be named. ""The Pakistani side has denied firing. Let's see."" The time of the hotline call between the Indian and Pakistani officials was not immediately known. On Wednesday, Islamabad denied it had violated the ceasefire in the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir, spark of two of three wars between Indian and Pakistan, and over which they skirmished in 2002. India and Pakistan began the ceasefire November 25, 2003, after routinely exchanging artillery fire across the volatile Line of Control, the de facto border separating their armies in Kashmir, as part of a tentative peace process. ""No one from Pakistan has fired and there is no ceasefire violation by Pakistan,"" Pakistan military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan told AFP in Islamabad. The firing was front-page news in Indian newspapers. ""Pakistan opens fire across Line of Control,"" said The Hindu. Indian police said Tuesday at least one person was injured when about 15 mortars were fired into India from Pakistan over the Line of Control. The mortars came from across the border Tuesday evening and landed in India's Durga Post area in the Poonch sector, an Indian police spokesman said. Indian army officer Major General D. Samanwar told NDTV news channel the incident was tantamount to a ceasefire violation. ""Yes, it certainly is a violation. It's the first time it has happened but we've exercised full restraint,"" he said, adding troops had been put on alert. The two sides have been engaged in formal peace talks to normalise relations since January 2004.",2019
Bangladesh,G:\400\website\files//AFP_ENG_20050312.0019,"India's prime minister will personally flag off the first bus to travel between the Indian and Pakistan zones of divided Kashmir in almost six decades when the service resumes next month, an official said Saturday. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Kashmir in April will be his third since he assumed office in May. ""The prime minister will be in (the Indian Kashmir summer capital) Srinagar to flag off the first bus on April 7,"" Singh's spokesman said. The bus service is the first tangible result of 14 months of dialogue between the nuclear-armed neighbours who have fought three wars including two over Kashmir, which each hold in part but claim in full. India and Pakistan agreed last month that Kashmiri residents would not need passports to cross the divided state by bus but would use permits issued by the civil administration after being cleared by police. The bus service was suspended in 1947 after the first India-Pakistan war over Kashmir. The second was in 1965. Indian Kashmir is in the grip of a 15-year-old insurgency that has so far left thousands dead. India blames Pakistan for fomenting the insurgency in Kashmir which has left at least 40,000 dead according Indian estimates, though separatists put the toll at twice that number. Pakistan denies supporting the rebels though it admits to extending moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiris' freedom struggle. Indian authorities last week said some 150 permits had been issued to applicants from Indian-Kashmir to travel by the bus linking Srinagar to Muzaffarabad, capital of the Pakistan-administered zone. Of the 150 applicants, 60 will be short-listed for the first two trips -- the first on April 7 and the second a fortnight later -- an official said.",1752
